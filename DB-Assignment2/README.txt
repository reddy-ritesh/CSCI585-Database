"Which employees have consistently reported being healthy in the given period and have had no symptoms, no positive tests, and no cases?"

This will help us identify employees who have remained unaffected during a specific timeframe, which might be useful for planning purposes or for health tracking. This question can be answered using table division.

Description:
Identify employees who have:

Not reported any symptoms.
Not tested positive.
Not been registered as a case.

The AllEmployees common table expression (CTE) is a list of all employees.
The SymptomaticEmployees CTE lists all employees who reported symptoms in the given date range.
The PositiveTestEmployees CTE lists all employees who tested positive in the given date range.
The CaseEmployees CTE lists all employees who were registered as cases in the given date range.
The final query selects all employees who are not in any of the other three lists, implying they remained unaffected during the given period.
